# Javascript functions fundementals

Use this project for your tech challenge. 

To start your project, you'll need to run `npm install` and once that's finished then run `npm run test:watch`

Think about using a TDD (test-driven-development) approach to give you an extra level of confidence as you code.

## Tech challenges: 
1. Use the `challenge/greetMe.test.js` file to look at the greetMe function. Look at the unit tests, update your function until all tests pass.
2. Use the `challenge/calculateFahrenheit.test.js` file to look at the calculateFahrenheit function. Fill in the function body of `calculateFahrenheit` until the tests pass. (You may need to use google to find out the equation!)
3. Use the `challenge/formatAddress.test.js` file to look at the formatAddress function. Fill in the function body of `formatAddress` until the tests pass. Look closely at the expectations for the postcodes, and the casing of the place names. 
4. Use the `challenge/repeatMe.test.js` file to write a function that takes 2 parameters, a number and a string. Running the function should give the string you passed in repeated the number of times you've given. Each repetition of the string should alternate between upper and lower case.
