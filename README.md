# Javascript functions fundementals

Use this project to look over the tutorial's demo exercises, and for your tech challenge. 

To start your project, you'll need to run `npm install`. 

For each challenge, start your test suite watching by running `npm run test:watch` before you start coding. 

Think about using a TDD (test-driven-development) approach to give you an extra level of confidence as you code.

## Tech challenges: 
1. Use the `challenge/greetMe.test.js` file to look at the greetMe function. Look at the unit tests, update your function until all tests pass.
2. Use the `challenge/calculateFahrenheit.test.js` file to look at the calculateFahrenheit function. Fill in the function body of `calculateFahrenheit` until the tests pass. (You may need to use google to find out the equation!)
3. Use the `challenge/calculateCelsius.test.js` file to look at the calculateCelsius function. Fill in the function body of `calculateCelsius` until the tests pass. (You may need to use google to find out the equation!)
4. Use the `challenge/formatAddress.test.js` file to look at the formatAddress function. Fill in the function body of `formatAddress` until the tests pass. Once they've started passing, see if you can find any opportunities to reduce repetition in your code. Look closely at the expectations for the postcodes, and the casing of the place names. 

## Commands to use: 
Run `npm run test --watch` to start your test suite running. Leave this running while you develop your functions
